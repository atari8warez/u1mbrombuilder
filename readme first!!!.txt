READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY.....

1.) Extract the files and folders included in the archive to a folder of your choice. Create a shortcut to the executable file U1MBRomB.exe to run the program.

2.) Reserved Rom Names shown in the main window of the software are user customizable. Double-click on the Rom Name to redefine them (i.e. GUI, PBI etc..). The program will save the new descriptions and remember them on subsequent sessions.

3.) The flasher software included in the ROMS folder is for U1MB SDX flashing and is distributed by the DLT team within the SDX445_images.zip archive. It is intended to flash the SDX part of the flash rom (first 32 banks) on the U1MB upgrade. When run with a full U1MB Rom image however it seems to flash all 64 banks. When tested with Altirra this procedure seems to do a complete flash (Watch the included video to see  the Atari Pilot programming language also being flashed successfuly).

This flasher was not publicly announced as "the U1MB flasher" so use caution and fully test it with the emulator. I am not in any way responsible for bad flashes and the flasher is only included for testing purposes, use it on your real hardware AT YOUR OWN RISK!.
