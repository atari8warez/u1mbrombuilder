Nov 8, 2013 - v1.0.4
	+ Updated the flasher component. New flasher is said to support the SST 39SF040 Chip in the U1MB (not tested by me). For the latest version of this flasher always check "SDX446_ultimate.atr" file from the SDX project website. The flasher can be updated by replacing the file "flasher.com" in the application's ROMS folder with the new flasher from "SDX446_ultimate.atr".

Jan 25, 2013 - v1.0.1

	* Updated Turkish Language translation.

	* Fixed a problem where slot description changes were not propagated if an ATR is created without first saving the modified BIOS
 	  Rom file. The program now prompts the user to save the modifications before creating the ATR.

	* BASIC Slot 1 description length was not limited to 14 characters, and if the user entered more than 14 characters the description
	  was trancated when saved to the BIOS ROM. Restricted the description entry to 14 chars.
